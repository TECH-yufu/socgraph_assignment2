In the early days of the universe, Laufey ruled Jotunheim, realm of the Frost Giants. When his son Loki was born a runt, an ashamed Laufey ordered the baby hidden.

Odin, the King of Asgard, marched his forces into Jotunheim.Journey into Mystery #112 (Jan. 1965) Welding the mystical hammer Mjolnir,Thor vol. 2 #80 (Aug. 2004) Odin faced down Laufey and destroyed his war club, prompting the Frost Giant to brandish a sword. Laufey tried to use his knowledge of land, such as trying to stop Odin with a concealed fire pit. A sprawling battle between the two forces ensued. The battle ended when Odin used Mjolnir to crush Laufey's skull. Odin discovered Loki in the wreckage of the castle and decided to raise him as his own. 

It was later retconned that Loki had been a child, rather than a baby, when Laufey was killed. The day before the battle, Loki had attempted to inform his father of an opportunity to stealthily kill Odin. Laufey struck Loki for calling him a coward.Thor vol. 3 #12 (Jan. 2009) The next day, after the fateful battle and Odin's claiming of Loki as a son, Laufey was left wounded, but alive.
