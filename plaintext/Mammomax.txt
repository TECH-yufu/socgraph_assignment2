The Brotherhood of Mutants, also known as the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and the Brotherhood, is a team of comic book mutant supervillains in Marvel Comics' universe who are devoted to mutant superiority over normal humans. Their roster has varied and has included many powerful and dangerous mutants, and they have often been at odds with the X-Men, although on rare occasions they have worked alongside them, usually in order to overcome some greater evil. The original Brotherhood first appeared in The Uncanny X-Men #4 (March 1964), and were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.
