Powers and abilities
Reptyl possessed superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes as a result of his reptilian alien heritage, as well as a vulnerability to extreme cold. He resembled a humanoid dinosaur (Saurornithoides) with green scaly ridged hide, sharpened teeth and claws, and a  tail. He was an experienced armed and unarmed combatant, a highly skilled leader and space pilot, and a master of most known hand weapons. He wore body armor and a space suit of alien materials, and carried a ray-pistol and sword.

Reptyl later became Reptyl Prime as a result of genetic mutation. His superhuman strength and stamina increased, he gained the ability to fly at warp speed, and was no longer vulnerable to cold. He resembles a  mythological dragon with grey scaly ridged hide, sharpened teeth and  claws, bat-like wings [ wingspan], and a  spiked tail. Reptyl Prime also gained the ability to manipulate cosmic energy in the form of concussive blasts of cosmic force, and the ability to exist in space unprotected.
