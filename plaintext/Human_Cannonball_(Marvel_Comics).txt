Fictional character biography
Jack Pulver was born in Burbank, California. He is a member of the criminal organization, the Circus of Crime, and works as a human cannonball and acrobat who specializes in being shot out of a cannon. He wears a costume and helmet that protects him from injury. He initially wears a red crash helmet and purple jumpsuit. In a battle with the Hulk, he has himself shot out of his cannon at the Green Goliath with no other weapon but a replica of Thor's hammer. The Hulk punches him right up through the top of the circus tent. This stunt, and subsequent dialogue, makes it pretty clear that Jack is not all that smart.The Incredible Hulk #3 (Sept. 1962)

When the Circus of Crime next appears, Jack has changed his outfit. His costume is now orange and he has replaced the crash helmet with a metal bullet-shaped hat so he can use his head as a battering ram. It doesn't help him. Spider-Man and Daredevil ride him through the air like a bucking bronco and steer him into a crash with a group of circus rubes.The Amazing Spider-Man #16 (Sept. 1964)

Frustrated by this defeat, Cannonball is more than willing to throw in with the Clown, Princess Python and Great Gambonnos. They kick the Ringmaster out and become the Masters of Menace, a name Princess Python thinks up, led by the Clown. With the Great Gambannos he robs some paintings as he is used to batter through a door and knocks out Jameson using his helmet, placing him in hospital. When Spider-Man attacks the Masters at their hideout, the web-slinger "wonks" Cannonball on the top of his bullet hat, crumpling it and knocking it down over his eyes.The Amazing Spider-Man #22 (March 1965) He rejoins the Ringmaster when he fails to lure Hawkeye, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch into the group. Quicksilver easily defeats him.The Avengers #21-22 (Oct.-Nov. 1965)
