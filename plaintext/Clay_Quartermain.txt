Fictional character biography
Clay Quartermain is a high-ranking agent of the fictional espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., a "blond-haired, fast-talking, grinning Burt Lancaster" sort who first worked with that organization's storied executive director Nick Fury during S.H.I.E.L.D.'s first conflict with would-be world tyrant the Yellow Claw, later revealed to have been a robot simulacrum of that Chinese-national Mandarin. Quartermain later became part of the U.S. military's "Hulkbusters" operation, which attempted to capture and contain the Hulk.

He became a fugitive and traveled with Rick Jones and the Hulk. He met his brother, a farmer. He testified in Congress about a mass murder committed by the supervillain known as the Leader who had detonated a gamma bomb in a town to obliterate.The Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #337-343 (November 1987-April 1988)

Once more at S.H.I.E.L.D., Quartermain, along with many other agents, was seemingly killed by a self-aware, renegade "Deltan" variety of the agency's artificial-human "Life Model Decoys", and replaced by one such LMD.Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. #2 (July 1988) The most advanced of the Deltite LMDs, it rebelled upon learning it was not human, and after several confrontations, perished.Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. #6 (November 1988)

Retconned as a former romantic interest of Jessica Jones, Quartermain later became leader of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Paranormal Containment Unit. He was the agent sent to inform Jennifer Walters (She-Hulk) that she had been pressed into service as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.She-Hulk (vol. 2) #14 (January 2007) He next led a new incarnation of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s "Hulkbusters" unit, here She-Hulk, Agent Crimson, and Agent Cheesecake.She-Hulk (vol. 2) #15 (March 2007) Clay and his team then defeated the electrical entity Zzzax.She-Hulk (vol. 2) #17 (April 2007)

The commanding officer of the crime scene was his old friend Gabe Jones.Hulk (vol. 2) #4 (June 2008) It was later revealed, however, that his actual murderer was the now-insane Doc Samson. Quartermain had inadvertently stumbled upon a plot hatched by Red Hulk and Samson, and threatened to launch a full-scale investigation.
