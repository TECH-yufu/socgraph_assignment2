MC2 Bluestreak

Bluestreak (Blue Kelso) is a fictional character who appeared in the Marvel Comics series A-Next. The character appears as a mutant capable of running at superhuman speeds. Her top velocity is unknown, but she is shown to be able to exceed the speed of sound. She is also shown to possess incredible stamina. She is a mutant gifted with incredible speed, who left the newest incarnation of the X-Men (the X-People) because they were not "flashy" enough for her. Bluestreak's real name is later revealed as Blue Kelso.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe (2006) #2.

Bluestreak appears as a member of the Dream Team, who soon become part of the new Avengers team. She quickly develops a crush on teammate J2 (a fact to which he is completely oblivious). Bluestreak is characterized as cocky and impulsive, with a cheerful attitude, and is shown having problems following the orders of Mainframe. When Mainframe's inert body needs to be taken across the city in less than a minute, she places him on a gurney and covers the needed distance in virtually no time at all, even remarking afterwards that she could have stopped for a sandwich, but did not want to show off.
