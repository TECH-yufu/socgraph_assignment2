Fictional character biography
Fandral is a warrior of Asgard and an adventurer. He is an irrepressible swashbuckler and romantic. His bravery and optimism often puts the group in highly disadvantageous positions; as perennially pointed out by the gloomy Hogun. Fandral considers himself the consummate ladies' man and is often depicted with a bevy of young ladies.

Powers and abilities
Fandral is a member of the race of superhumans known as Asgardians.  Like all Asgardians, he possesses superhuman strength, speed, agility, stamina, and durability.

Fandral is a master swordsman, and excellent overall battlefield warrior. He is highly proficient in the use of all edged weapons, and his superhuman dexterity, speed, and agility are all significantly greater than the average Asgardian male. Thor himself refers to Fandral as "the best of us with the blade". Like all Asgardians, Fandral's bone, skin and muscle are roughly 3 times denser than a typical human, giving him an extremely high resistance to injury and superhuman strength.

Fandral rides a horse named Firehooves. He can also use the Asgardian Starjammer for transportation.
