Fictional character biography
Dirk Garthwaite, a.k.a. the Wrecker, first appeared in Thor, and is depicted as a former manual laborer for a demolitions crew who is fired for his violent and anti-social tendencies. Garthwaite created a costume for himself and called himself the Wrecker, committing a series of robberies, demolishing looted locations and leaving a crowbar at the scene of the crime. The Wrecker entered a hotel room occupied by Asgardian god Loki, the adopted brother and archenemy of the Thunder God Thor. Upon knocking out the de-powered Loki, the Wrecker put on his helmet and received an enchantment from Loki's ally, Karnilla the Norn Queen, who assumed he was Loki because the Wrecker was wearing his helmet and she only saw him from the back. Therefore, Karniila was the source of his newfound enchanted powers. Reveling in his power, the Wrecker embarked on a crime spree and defeated Thor who, at the time, had had his power severely reduced by his father Odin (ruler of the Norse gods) as punishment for choosing to remain on Earth. A building collapsed onto the Thunder God, nearly killing him. The Wrecker was defeated by the Asgardian goddess Sif, who animated the armor of the Asgardian Destroyer to save Thor. The Wrecker's crowbar was shattered.Thor #148 - 150 (Jan. - March 1968)

The Wrecker returned and battled Thor again, although a fully restored Thor easily defeated him.Thor #171 (Dec. 1969)

The Wrecker returned in The Defenders, and this time appeared with three superpowered partners in crime: Bulldozer, Piledriver and Thunderball. Empowered when holding the crowbar as it is struck by lightning, the villains joined the Wrecker to become the Wrecking Crew. While searching for a gamma bomb built by Thunderball with which they hope to extort New York City, the Wrecking Crew battled several members of the Defenders: Doctor Strange; Nighthawk and the Hulk.

Powers and abilities
Courtesy of an Asgardian enchantment placed on him by mistake by Karnilla the Norn Queen, the Wrecker possesses superhuman strength, stamina and durability (bulletproof). When he initially shares the Norn power with the rest of the Wrecking Crew, the Wrecker's abilities were reduced by one-fourth. After receiving training from Ulik the Rock Troll, the Wrecker no longer suffers from this handicap and is now capable of using his powers to their full potential and use the crowbar in the same fashion that Thor can utilize his mystic hammer Mjolnir. He has used the crowbar to demolish entire buildings in minutes and to hold off the Thunder God Thor in battle. The Wrecker primarily uses the crowbar offensively as both a throwing and blunt weapon. While the Wrecker is the true source of the power, at times the power can be transferred into the crowbar.

The crowbar's secondary abilities include absorbing and projecting energy, creating illusions, generating a force field, creating minor earthquakes, teleportation and returning to the Wrecker when thrown. The Wrecker also shares a mental link with the crowbar and can mentally control any weak-minded individual who touches it. The Wrecker was also able to temporarily mystically impart superhuman strength to the individual and surround him/her in an impenetrable force field around that person that would protect that person until the individual reached the Wrecker. The individual would be in a trance-like state while they were holding the crowbar and under the Wrecker's control. The trance would be broken once the crowbar was in the Wrecker's possession and the person would have no memory of their experience with the crowbar. The Wrecker is the most powerful member of the Wrecking Crew and while many believe his crowbar is the source of their powers (Thunderball thought that when he attempted to steal the crowbar, until his hand was crushed by the Wrecker in a "friendly" hand-shake while the crowbar was in Thunderball's possession), it is the Wrecker himself that is the source of the Wrecking Crew's powers, especially after Ulik's training.Thor #418
